# Abizeugs

These are some tools for our Abitur (2021). They are very poorly written and should never be used by anyone except us (RBS TG13).

## Installation
* Install `nodejs`, `npm`, `redis` and `mariadb`. As the installation instructions vary depending on the platform, please look it up on your own
* Start `redis` and `mariadb`
* Create a `mariadb` database
* Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and edit the file accordingly
* Edit `mottos.txt`, `poll.txt` and `name.csv` (not published due to data protection)
* Run `npm i`
* Start the server with `node app`
